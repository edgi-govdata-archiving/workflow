## What Do Seeders Do?

Seeders canvass the resources of a given government agency, identifying important URLs. They identify whether those URLs can be crawled by the [Internet Archive's](http://archive.org) web crawler. Using the [EDGI Nomination Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nominationtool/abjpihafglmijnkkoppbookfkkanklok?hl=en), Seeders nominate crawlable URLs to the Internet Archive or add them to the Archivers app if they require manual archiving.

## Choosing the Website

Seeders use the [EDGI Archiving Primers](https://envirodatagov.org/archiving/), or a similar set of resources, to identify important and at-risk data. Talk to the DataRescue organizers to learn more.

## Canvassing the Website and Evaluating Content

- Start exploring the website assigned, identifying important URLs.
- Decide whether the data on a page or website subsection can be automatically captured by the Internet Archive web crawler.
- [EDGI's Guides](https://edgi-govdata-archiving.github.io/guides/) have information critical to the seeding and sorting process:
    - [Understanding the Internet Archive Web Crawler](https://edgi-govdata-archiving.github.io/guides/internet-archive-crawler/)
    - [Seeding the Internet Archive’s Web Crawler](https://edgi-govdata-archiving.github.io/guides/seeding-internet-archive/)

### Crawlable URLs

- URLs judged to be crawlable are nominated ("seeded") to the Internet Archive, using the [EDGI Nomination Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nominationtool/abjpihafglmijnkkoppbookfkkanklok?hl=en).

**Wherever possible, add in the Agency Office Code from the sub-primer.** Talk to the DataRescue organizers to learn more.

### Uncrawlable URLs

- If URL is judged not crawlable, check one of the checkboxes next to the four types of uncrawlables in the Chrome Extension. This will add the URL to the Researching queue in the Archivers app.
- The URL will be automatically associated with a universal unique identifier (UUID).
- You can check whether the page or some files are archived using the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak)

### Not Sure?

- This sorting is only provisional; when in doubt, Seeders nominate the URL **and** mark it as possibly not crawlable.
